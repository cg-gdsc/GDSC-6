    "In the last tutorial, we trained and evaluated the first model on a small sample of data. While it is possible to train a model within [Sagemaker Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQc8Itd4UTs&list=PLhr1KZpdzukcOr_6j_zmSrvYnLUtgqsZz) it's better to use a Sagemaker training job instead. Sagemaker training jobs have several advantages over a normal notebook. To name few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- provide you with a nice overview of all the training you ran\n",
    "- automatically store the results of a training run (metrics, [logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) and models)\n",
    "- do not automatically shut down after a few hours (which we enabled in the notebooks)\n",
    "- allows running multiple training jobs in parallel (if you have sufficient GPUs allocated)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will convert the approach from tutorial 4 into a Sagemaker training job and train our model on the full data set. During the training, the logs are sent to [Cloudwatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) - AWS monitoring service. After the training is completed, the model is saved and automatically uploaded to S3. From there we'll retrieve the model and evaluate it.\n",
